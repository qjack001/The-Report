Rada Kuznet (pictured) was unable to reveal whether or not her pizza recipe contains garlic. After a student inquired about the presence of the ingredient, as they are allergic to it, Kuznet replied that she would not divulge her “top secret” pizza technique. Good to know that the school prioritizes its culinary offerings above the well-being of its students. 

What recipe is so basic that simply *knowing* if it contains garlic would spoil it? Scratching my head.
