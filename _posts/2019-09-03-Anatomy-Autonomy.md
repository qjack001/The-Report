Were a student to have an allergic reaction, the school would surely follow emergency procedures. The student would be sent to the school nurse, and an antihistamine would be administered.

While some employees of the school have—somewhat mindbogglingly—contended such a basic notion (see: “Kuznet’s ‘Secret’”), dealing with the allergy is a response in which a majority of us can agree upon. No student would be blamed for their condition, and no teacher would deny the student the right to attend to their needs.

I use this example to illustrate a point. An extreme to help illuminate a subtlety: when I need to pee, I should be allowed to pee.

Sure, it’s not *urgent*, I can “hold it,” but a bladder infection should not be the price paid for proper daily hydration. Nor should the humiliation of peeing oneself. Were it not a necessity I wouldn’t *want* to leave your *very interesting class*.

How, Mr. Wahlburg, does answering a trivia question earn me such a fundamental human right? How can a two-trip limit reflect the complex biological needs of a developing adolescent, Ms. Loris? How, Vice Principal Denominator, can a tactic used to torture prisoners of war alongside sleep deprivation and starvation be permitted in your school?

Sammy, the hall monitor and self-described “integral part” of this whole farce, gave his two cents: “too many people use going to the bathroom as an excuse to avoid learning.” But if the goal truly is learning, the school would be far better off entrusting its students with a shred of autonomy, allowing them to deal with their own bodily functions. I, for one, have certainly never been able to focus on King Charlemagne while trying not to piss my pants.
