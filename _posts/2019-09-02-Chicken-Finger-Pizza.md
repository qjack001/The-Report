“It’s certainly a little weird,” Ms. Morton spoke of the chicken-finger-pizza served at today’s lunch. The inventive creation—or rather, abomination—combines the two things kids love most: pizza and a lack of restraint.

Rada Kuznet, the cafeteria’s head chef, defended the lunch, saying, “I make what I believe has a need to exist. My pizza had that need, so I could either wait around for someone to take my idea, or I could do it myself.” When asked if the meal turned out the way she’d envisioned, she declined to answer and the interview was cut short.

Kuznet’s abruptness may appear defensive amidst the sea of rumours lobbied against her. Chief among those is the allegation that the chicken fingers topping today’s pizza were sourced from the previous lunch’s leftovers, served over two months ago.

The rumour began to surface shortly after Alec Thomson was witnessed up-chucking the pizza near the volleyball court. (Anonymous) critics have reportedly called the allegation “baseless,” however, citing Thomson’s almost predictable predisposition to vomiting.

When reached for comment, the school provided it’s all too familiar boilerplate: “The school cafeteria has passed repeated health inspection, and the recent string of food poisoning occurrences have no connection to the school whatsoever.” Unconvincing.

Following-up on her initial comments, Ms. Morton stated, “Last year’s was much better,” referencing the mac-and-cheese-stuffed-meatballs served during the previous year’s ‘welcome back lunch.’  If the chicken-finger-pizza represents the school cafeteria at it’s worst, then the mac-and-cheese-meatballs was it’s best. The meal’s complex flavour profile and diverse texture exemplified the power of Kuznet’s creative vision; a successes the school has yet to prove replicable.
