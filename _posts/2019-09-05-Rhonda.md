It turns out that there are actually more than two readers of this paper, and the three of you know all too well How This Goes. I’m that guy, snorting crushed up chalk in the back of the class, ready to go off on some ideological rant the moment an authority figure even so much as attempts to ask me to quiet down. And this paper, as you also know, is my outlet of choice, tearing down the very institutions in which it is built upon.

So it may come as a surprise, but this article will operate differently. While I’ve almost exclusively used my platform to illuminate the injustices present in the shadows of our school, I have yet to spotlight those that rise above the filth. So let’s change that.

Given the recent turmoil surrounding the school—deaths, disappearances, and otherwise—I feel that it’s important to remember that there are still those out there bringing joy to this school. And it is important to celebrate those gems. Let’s get ready to Rhonda, Frankfurt Intermediary.
